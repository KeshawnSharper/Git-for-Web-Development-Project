git reset is when you use the gitbash  to modify uncommited files. 

default = returns the commited changes 
and stores the uncommited to a unstaged
state

hard = returns everything commited and deletes 
uncommited changes. 


git revert is when git makes a new commit 
out of the previous commit changes

git clean will delete untracked files
(files that have not been added 
with the command : git add )
