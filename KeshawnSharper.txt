Stretch Problem:

 1. Merge conflicts is when git needs help choosing what changes are to be pushed into the final merge. 
 2. pull commands recieves and downloads content from a remote repo and updates to match the content
 3. rebase is when you take the changes and elements off of one branch and submit them to an other branch.
 4. reset is when you reset all of the index entries to their original state 
 5. revert is when you are Given one or more existing commits, revert the changes that the related patches introduce, and record some new commits that record them. This requires your working tree to be clean (no modifications from the HEAD commit).
 6. clean is when git removes files or cleans that aren't under version control
